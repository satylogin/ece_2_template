				<h2>PROJECTS</h2><hr>
				
				<p>
					Projects are a result of the culmination of ideas and efforts. At IIIT Allahabad, it is our ultimate goal to inclucate into our students the capability to follow their own dreams, and fabricate them in the realm of possiblity. The primary objective of our mentors is to give the student only the necessary pieces of the puzzle, and the motivation to not give up against all odds...

					<h2> Impurities detection in Liquids using RF sensor </h2><hr>
					
					<p>
						<strong>Description</strong> :Our aim is to design a device which can detect resonance frequency of any pure as well as impure liquid without using Vector Network Analyzer so that  it could be a cost effective device. we are using a RF source to generate input to the device and the same RF source to be given to the mixer. Output frequency of the device and tuner frequency will be fed to a device which will provide output only when both the frequencies will be same. we have precaliberated table of frequency change vs impurity level, after a little processing of data (frequency change and table)  in  microcontroller we will get to know the level of impurities.<br>	<strong>Mentor</strong> :Dr. Nitesh Purohit & Dr. B.R. Singh<br>	<strong>Year</strong> :2016<br> <strong>Semester 5 :</strong><br>	<strong>Members</strong><br>IEC2014086	IEC2014005	IEC2014059

					<h2> True random number generator using ring oscillator in FPGA </h2><hr>
					
					<p>
						<strong>Description</strong> : True random number generator (TRNG) uses a non-deterministic source (entropy source) and further processes it to generate the sequence of random numbers. This nondeterministic source is some physical source such as noise in circuits, quantum effects, mouse movements, key strokes etc. It involves the conversion of analogue noise to digital signal. Generally, TRNG samples the source of entropy and further processes it to get a sequence of statistically independent bits.<br>	<strong>Mentor</strong> :Dr. Manish Goswami<br>	<strong>Year</strong> :2016<br> <strong>Semester 3 :</strong><br>	<strong>Members</strong><br>IMI2015005

					<h2> Delay Minimization in Multipath Wireless Sensor Network </h2><hr>
					
					<p>
						<strong>Description</strong> :Most of the wireless sensor networks in practical applications are multihop networks. In these networks the data can be received by the center node(sink node) via various paths with varying delay. The end-to-end delay of the event triggered wireless sensor network is optimized with the help of Target Prediction Sleep Scheduling(TPSS) algorithm. The algorithm chooses the path with least delay for the data transfer. The delay is minimized keeping the energy utilization minimum. A sensor network is simulated in MATLAB GUI where on giving event information, the MATLAB code determines the data transfer path, energy consumed by the participating nodes and the total delay.<br>	<strong>Mentor</strong> :Prof. M Radhakrishnan<br>	<strong>Year</strong> :2013<br> <strong>Semester 7 :</strong><br>	<strong>Members</strong><br>IEC2010047
