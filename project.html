						<strong>Description</strong> :The project is designed to develop a density based dynamic traffic signal system having remote override facilities. During normal time the signal timing changes automatically on sensing the traffic density at the junction but in the event of any emergency vehicle like ambulance, fire brigade etc requiring priority  are built in with RF remote control to override the set timing by providing instantaneous green signal in the desired direction while blocking the other lanes by red signal for some time. Traffic congestion is a severe problem in many major cities across the world thus it is felt imperative to provide such facilities to important vehicles.

						Conventional traffic light system is based on fixed time concept allotted to each side of the junction which cannot be varied as per varying traffic density. Junction timings allotted are fixed. Sometimes higher traffic density at one side of the junction demands longer green time as compared to standard allotted time.<br>	<strong>Mentor</strong> :Dr Suneel Yadav<br>	<strong>Year</strong> :2016<br> <strong>Semester 8 :</strong><br>	<strong>Members</strong><br>iec2012037

The Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) is a feature descriptor used in computer vision and image processing for the purpose of object detection. They provide excellent performance relative to other existing feature sets. 
We used Linear Support Vector Machine as a baseline classifier to classify a given object as person or non-person.

						<strong>Description</strong> :In this project an Operational amplifier with differential input and single ended output is designed. The Operational amplifier operates on a 1.8V supply voltage and has very good  gain, gain bandwidth product, slew rate and power consumption. The operational amplifier is designed using 180nm CMOS technology. This operational amplifier achieves 30MHz unity gain frequency and 460 phase margin for 1pF load capacitance.  This operational amplifier is used to design a low pass filter which meet to bluetooth standard requirements.We designed the operational amplifier with channel length 540nm. Then we compared the Gain, Phase Margin, -3 dB GBW and unity GBW of this op-amp with channel length 180nm and 360nm by keeping W/L ratio of each transistor same. The design and simulation of operational amplifier is done in CADENCE design system.

						<strong>Description</strong> :Vector Network Analyzer is a key component in RF Design, Testing and Verification. It is used to measure the network parameters (mainly S-parameters) of RF based circuits. It is very sophisticated and costly instrument, so it is mandatory for the personnel to handle the instrument with utmost care. While extracting the data from the instrument on an external storage device, it may get affected by malware programs. So we want to avoid the use of any external storage device directly on VNA. Due to the very high cost of VNA it is not easily accessible. So, in order to cope up with these difficulties, interfacing with external controllers is required. In this project we are using a Personal Computer as an external controller. We are using TCPIP(Ethernet) standard for accomplishing our task.<br>	<strong>Mentor</strong> :Dr. Seema Awasthi<br>	<strong>Year</strong> :2016<br> <strong>Semester 6 :</strong><br>	<strong>Members</strong><br>IEC2013018	IEC2013056	IEC2013057

These testing chips becomes more important as move to submicron technology like 90nm where even a slight variation can cause greater effect in the functionality of the product design. We make Testing Ring Oscillators for various devices of multiple stages. Physical verification steps (DRC, LVS etc.) are also done for these test structure designs. The technology for which these test structures is 90nm and using thick gate oxide approach.

In the bus detection subsystem, the nearby stations will be easily detected and then announced through a voice message inside the bus. Moreover any existing blind person in the surrounding area of the station will be detected by the bus subsystem to alert the bus driver about the number of blind persons. In the bus station subsystem, the coming buses will be detected and then announced in the station in order to alert the blind people. So, overall this system would aid in travelling of visually impaired persons.<br>	<strong>Mentor</strong> :Dr. Rekha Verma<br>	<strong>Year</strong> :2016<br> <strong>Semester 8 :</strong><br>	<strong>Members</strong><br>IEC2012014

First of all I divide the given video in its constituent frames/segments and then we extract features from each frame/segment. Then I have used semantic features  for summarization of video signal. . Semantic video summarization is a method in which we consider only the meaningful segments of the video For obtaining the semantic features we used the SIFT algorithm . Scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) is an algorithm in computer vision to detect and describe local features in images.

It enables the user to add and place compartments, drawer units and kitchen hardwares like sink,
refrigerator, hob etc, and further customize them as per choice. Live 3D rendering while
customizing makes the tool a lot more user friendly. Finally there is a provision to produce photo-realistic
images of the designs made.<br>	<strong>Mentor</strong> :Dr. Sitangshu Bhattacharya<br>	<strong>Year</strong> :2016<br> <strong>Semester 8 :</strong><br>	<strong>Members</strong><br>IEC2012003

						<strong>Description</strong> :This project gives a brief introduction about controlling Robot Car and removing obstacles using Robotic Arm. In this project, an Android App is interfacing with raspberry pi remotely using SSH. It makes portable to carry mobile rather than laptop for controlling robot car. It gives an introduction towards obstacle remover system and an overview of experimental studies of controlling with raspberry pi and Arduino mega 2560.Earlier, Laptop is controlling all desired operations of Raspberry pi but it is not possible to carry laptop everywhere. So, It is easier to built an an Android App for performing various  operations on Raspberry Pi and controlling Robot Car. And another app is performing live video streaming on android mobile. <br>	<strong>Mentor</strong> :Arun Kant Singh<br>	<strong>Year</strong> :2016<br> <strong>Semester 6 :</strong><br>	<strong>Members</strong><br>IEC2013099	IEC2013090	IEC2013082

					<div>
						<strong>Description</strong> :Fully automatic segmentation of objects in unconstrained real world scenarios is a challenging unsolved problem. On the other hand, semi-automatic or interactive segmentation methods aim at segmenting desired objects in a scene with minimal user effort. There exists several methods that fall under this domain, such as, graph-cuts, active contours, random walk, etc. Most of these methods concentrate on achieving object segmentation in an image or a frame. In the last few years, methods based on exploring spatio-temporal properties had shown attractive results in achieving object segmentation in videos. This work concentrates on establishing spatio-temporal correspondences between superpixels in neighboring frames in videos to obtain object segmentation. Experimental evaluation on SegTrackv2 dataset demonstrate the contributions of the presented method.<br>	<strong>Mentor</strong> :Dr. Rekha Verma<br>	<strong>Year</strong> :2016<br> <strong>Semester 8 :</strong><br>	<strong>Members</strong><br>IEC2012007

						<strong>Description</strong> :1. Developed algorithm which gives the number of access points required for both coverage and capacity based planning according to inputs taken (Model , Client Type , Client Protocol , Act Radio , Number of Users , Applications) while providing information about the received RSSI strength. 2. Plotted Wi-Fi heatmap (contour map based on RSSI strength) and further gives the estimate of total area coverage for each RSSI strength value. Each location is sufficient to meet the offered load at that location.
The algorithm can be used when access points operate in different modes (AP, Sensor, AP with background Scanning). 
The proposed algorithm is guaranteed to find a solution with at most O(n2) access points, if there exists a solution to the access point placement.

The end-to-end delay of the event triggered wireless sensor network is optimized with the help of Target Prediction Sleep Scheduling(TPSS) algorithm. The algorithm chooses the path with least delay for the data transfer. The delay is minimized keeping the energy utilization minimum. A sensor network is simulated in MATLAB GUI where on giving event information, the MATLAB code determines the data transfer path, energy consumed by the participating nodes and the total delay.<br>	<strong>Mentor</strong> :Prof. M Radhakrishnan<br>	<strong>Year</strong> :2013<br> <strong>Semester 7 :</strong><br>	<strong>Members</strong><br>IEC2010047
