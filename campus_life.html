						<p>
							At IIITA, we understand the importance of staying connected for the persuasion of knowledge and widening of vision. Following that philosophy, the institute ensures to provide connectivity to all its inhabitants in every fringe of the campus throughout the 24 hours. IIITA has a well established network infrastructure both for the local (LAN) as well as access to the internet. It is a medium-size network and approximately consists of 2000 nodes. The internal design is powered by providing dedicated wired as well as shared wireless network to every node in the campus. The network spans through every building on the campus. The internet is facilitated by a dedicated link from National Informatics Center of 250Mbps bandwidth including a redundant wireless link of 10Mbps to ensure connectivity in case of technical breakdown. A centralized server room monitors all network behaviour and facilitates distribution of the secure network to the entire campus. The IIITA network infrastructure is sophisticated and uses cutting edge technologies like Nexus Backbone switch, Unified Threat Management systems, Web Mail security and more. The network is prominently upgraded with time to meet the needs of all the users on the campus. Along with consistent connectivity, IIITA provided native web services to its users like E-Mail, Web Server, Profile service, Cloud file sharing, etc. All these web services and the network are responsibly managed by IIITA’s Network Development Engineering and Management Team, INDEM (http://indem.iiita.ac.in/). INDEM firmly believes in not only providing good service, but also educating its users regarding the network and its resources and thus has evolved into a student-cum-domain-experts body.

							"You can't win unless you learn how to lose" A healthy mind resides in a healthy body. IIIT-Allahabad provides an excellent physical activities infrastructure for its residents to ensure that academic development is duly supplemented by sufficient physical development as well. A well maintained football ground – complete with spectator stands serves as the principal venue for most of the sports events organized by “Spirit” – the sports club of IIIT-Allahabad. A duly marked athletic track circumscribing the ground serves to provide for a safe track for not only the athletic events – but the early morning joggers as well. Aquatic sports are catered to by a 25*12m swimming pool that is maintained to strict hygiene standards. The institute also provides flood lit basketball, tennis and squash courts to ensure that students have sufficient venues to engage in games of their choice.

						<p>
							Democracy is not something to be criticized, politics is not something from which we will shun ourselves away. The main motive of the formation of the Students' Gymkhana is to make the student community of IIIT-Allahabad a self-dependent organization. After a long wait, the opportunity of airing our voices is knocking at our doors. So let us embrace this project as a family and lets program and debug our way through this complex algorithm called "Gymkhana". Let us show the world that "Yes We Can!"...
